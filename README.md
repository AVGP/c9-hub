#Cloud9Hub

##What's this?
It's a simple interface for the Cloud 9 open source edition to easily create, use and manage multiple workspaces.
[The Cloud9 service](https://c9.io) has a shiny and awesome dashboard interface where you can manage multiple workspaces,
however the [open source edition](https://github.com/ajaxorg/cloud9) is a single workspace instance of Cloud9.

As I like the possibility to easily start working on different workspaces, create or delete them, I created Cloud9Hub to do so.

##What's Cloud9?
A full-blown IDE in your browser. It has a full terminal integration, can run and deploy code of different languages (e.g. Ruby, node.js, PHP)
and [lots more](https://c9.io/site/features/).

##Status Quo of Cloud9Hub
Right now it can
* Create new workspaces
* Launch multiple workspace instances
* Kill them automatically after 15 minutes
* List available workspaces
* Delete workspaces
* Manage multiple users
* Do authentication/sessions
* Sense, that you're active and will kill your workspace after 15-20 minutes of inactivity.

right now. These are the next steps for me to build (or you make a Pull Request with the features you want).

##Installation
First you will need [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), at least v0.8.

**Note, as of June, 12th 2013:** Cloud9 right now breaks when you try installing it with node > 0.8.x :(

1. Install [Cloud9](https://github.com/ajaxorg/cloud9) into some folder, say ``/var/awesomeness/cloud9``.
2. Then install Cloud9Hub into the parent folder above your cloud9 installation, so in my example``/var/awesomeness/cloud9hub`.
3. Copy the config.js.example file in the cloud9hub root folder to config.js and adjust the settings according to your setup.
4. Start Cloud9Hub with ``node server``.

##Running as a daemon
If you wish to, you can run it as a daemon, so that it stays alive.

To do so, I recommend [forever](https://npmjs.org/package/forever).
